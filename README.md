## Description

For this project, I had to make a personal portfolio to show my coding knowledge for future employer's. My motivation for doing this project was to push myself to go above and beyond with my new CSS knowledge. I built this project to show future employers what kind of knowledge I have in regards to coding while simultaneously challenging myself to try new things. The website I created now allows me to show off all of my work in one location. While working on this project I learned a lot of new tricks to css, especially flex box.

## Road Blocks

Whilst I was working on this project, many road blocks came to fruition. The first problem that arose dealt with the centering of my lines next to my header tags. Once I had the lines centered with each other, they would always shift out of line after the screen size was reduced. In order to fix this, I assigned the same class to all three headers so they maintained their position. The next major problem that arose while creating my website was flex box. I made the fatal mistake of creating my whole website first before dealing with any kind of screen size change. This meant most of my website was made out of absolute positioning which does not play well with different screen sizes. In order to fix this I changed most of my positioning properties to flex and relative along with changing the absolute elements widths and heights to percentages rather than pixels to accommodate smaller screen sizes. I also added the "auto" property to help with screen positioning as well.

## Learned Skills

Creating this website challenged me to think out of the box and combine my prior CSS knowledge with new knowledge I found online. One new skill that I have acquired from working on this project is creating a hamburger menu. While working on my flex boxes I realized that I needed to change up the nav bar in order to accommodate different screen sizes. Thats when I came up with the idea to use a hamburger menu. The menu makes the website feel very responsive when viewing it on mobile devices. Another skill I learned while creating my website was how to use transitions. Transitions are a very powerful tool to keep in your arsenal because they make your website feel more unique and interesting.
